# Car-Price-Prediction
Major Project done as part of Internship with Verzeo. Trained and Tested Multiple Models to predict used car prices.
Data was first analysed after which wefound and removed outliners. We then applied 5 models such as Linear Regression Model, SVM Model, Random Forest Generator, Decision Tree Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regression Tree Model.
Based on which model gave highest accurary we used it to predict prices for the test data. We used Random Forest Generator since it gave most accurate values.
